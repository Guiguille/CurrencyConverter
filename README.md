Money Exchange in Angular!
===================
Provide a simple currency converter in angularjs with online, offline mode.

> **Note:**
> - In Online mode it will return the exact currency exchange and then stored in localstorage
> - In Offline mode, if the exchange rate is already known in localstorage, it will convert with it.
